# TODO: Implement Store Functionality for QA Records (New Modal)

## Previous Steps (Original Route Fix)
- [x] Edit `routes/web.php` to correct the route definition by moving the `/quality-assurance` route outside the `/` route's closure.
- [x] Clear the route cache using `php artisan route:clear` to ensure new routes are loaded.
- [x] Test the `/quality-assurance` route by accessing it (e.g., via browser or `php artisan route:list` to verify registration).
- [x] Seed the database with `php artisan db:seed --class=QaRecordSeeder` for testing data.

## Previous Steps (Delete Functionality)
- [x] Edit `app/Http/Controllers/QualityAssuranceController.php` to add `destroy` method for deleting a QA record by ID.
- [x] Edit `routes/web.php` to add DELETE route for `/quality-assurance/{qa_record}` named `quality-assurance.destroy`.
- [x] Edit `resources/views/quality-assurance.blade.php` to add per-record delete forms/buttons inside each card, using `@method('DELETE')`, `route('quality-assurance.destroy', $record->id)`, and `@csrf`.
- [x] Clear route cache again (`php artisan route:clear`).
- [ ] Test: Launch browser to `/quality-assurance`, verify records display, delete a record, confirm removal and no errors.

## New Steps (Store Functionality)
- [x] Edit `app/Models/QaRecord.php` to add `$fillable` array for mass assignment: ['title', 'client', 'inspector', 'time', 'color'].
- [x] Edit `app/Http/Controllers/QualityAssuranceController.php` to add `store` method: Validate request (title, client, inspector, time, color required; color as string), create QaRecord, redirect with success message.
- [x] Edit `routes/web.php` to add POST route: `/quality-assurance` named `quality-assurance.store`.
- [x] Edit `resources/views/quality-assurance.blade.php` to add validation error display in modal form (e.g., `@error` directives for each field).
- [x] Clear route cache (`php artisan route:clear`).
- [ ] Test: Use "New" modal to add a record, verify creation and list update.
